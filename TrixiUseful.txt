update my local to current head (plus keep my "good" edits -> "sync my fork")

git fetch https://github.com/percival-desy/percival-characterization.git

git status
/// lists where I am now, "branch master" is MY master branch (i.e. on my fork), locally.

git remote
/// lists remote locations known.
I have
TrixisMasterRepo
origin


git checkout master
// seat myself on "my" master

git branch
// show all local branches

** git pull https://github.com/percival-desy/percival-characterization.git
// this fetches & merges ... seems to have worked?

** // now I need to also get my remote fork updated to this status
git commit -m "merged remote overall head with my local work"

** // while sitting on master :
git push https://github.com/Wunderer/percival-characterization.git master
